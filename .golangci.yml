  exclude:
    # _ instead of err checks
    - G104
    # for "public interface + private struct implementation" cases only!
    - exported func * returns unexported type *, which can be annoying to use
    # can be removed in the development phase
    - (comment on exported (method|function|type|const)|should have( a package)? comment|comment should be of the form)
    # not for the active development - can be removed in the stable phase
    - should have a package comment, unless it's in another file for this package
    - don't use an underscore in package name
    # errcheck: Almost all programs ignore errors on these functions and in most cases it's ok
    - Error return value of .((os\.)?std(out|err)\..*|.*Close|.*Flush|os\.Remove(All)?|.*printf?|os\.(Un)?Setenv|.*Rollback). is not checked
    - should check returned error before deferring
    - "not declared by package utf8"
    - "unicode/utf8/utf8.go"
    # Dns instead of DNS
    - (struct field|func|const) .*Dns.* should be .*DNS.*
